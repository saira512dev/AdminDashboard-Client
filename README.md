### How It's Made:
Tech used: React JS, Material UI, Redux-toolkit

Material UI makes styling really easy for the react front end. Redux-toolkit makes state management easy. API calls are all made at one place using redux-toolkit query.

### Optimizations
There is abutton added for Settings page. That could be implemented with admin having the choice of adding new users.

### Lessons Learned
Using Redux-toolkit to manage state and to make API calls in one place was a new experience for me.
